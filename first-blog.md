# This is my first blog

I always wanted to write and have my own page since a log time. Now the time has arrived.
Lately I was learning react and i was taking notes, but they were written on a word doc. Whenever I wasnted to revisit i could not refere on my mobile.
Also I always wanted to create a space where I can record my learnings and progress.

So Finally that time came. I considered using Github pages for blog posts. But I also wanted to put my React knowledges into test.
So instead using Github pages I careetd this react project for blogging.

```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
```
