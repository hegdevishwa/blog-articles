# This is my first blog

I always wanted to write and have my own page since a log time. Now the time has arrived.
Lately I was learning react and I was taking notes, but they were written on a word doc. Whenever I wanted to revisit I could not refer on my mobile. So as a learning i created my own page using React as this is a good exercise for learning UI and JS.

So Finally that time came. I considered using Github pages for blog posts. But I also wanted to put my React knowledges into test.
So instead using Github pages I careatd this react project for blogging.

var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
